**Zuanni, C., 2017. "Archaeological displays: Ancient objects, current beliefs" in G. Buggeln, C. Paine, and S. B. Plate (eds.), Religion in Museums: Today and Tomorrow. London: Bloomsbury Publishing.**

This chapter considers the display and representation of archaeological objects, linked to ancient and current religions, in museums. I observe how museum professionals have been discussing the ethical aspects of displaying religious objects, and how visitors - with their own religious backgrounds - interpret and perceive these objects.
