This paper aims to explore the so-called digital transformation of museums in 2020, reflecting on the long-term changes it might imply for digital strategies, skills, and engagement practices. It considers the experiences of 2020 and 2021 in the context of the history of museum digital practices, subsequently focusing on the digital divide that was emphasised by the pandemic, the perspectives for the development of new digital strategies and digital skills. Finally, it presents an overview of the main trends emerged from the digital initiatives launched by museums during the pandemic, highlighting the difficulties in evaluating their impact on audiences and in transforming these temporary solutions in long-term digital projects. In doing so, the paper aims to contribute to the discussion on the impact of the pandemic on museum digital practices.
