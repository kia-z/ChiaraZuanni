This Introduction, by the co-editors of this special issue, outlines the background to, and aims of “Cataloguing Magic.” It considers the ambiguity of the term “magic” and how it will be employed in relation to museum contexts throughout the issue, before specifying the broad questions this issue aims to address. The co-editors then detail the issue’s international contributors, who include academic researchers and curators, and the contexts in which they engage with the concept of “cataloguing magic.”
