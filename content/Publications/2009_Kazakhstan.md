**Zuanni, C., 2009. "The earliest archaeological evidence of Christianity in Kazakhstan" in G. Bonora, N. Pianciola, P. Sartori (eds.), Kazakhstan. Religions and Society in the History of Central Eurasia, Torino; New York: U. Allemandi, pp. 67-­79.**

This chapter was based on my Bachelor thesis, in which I looked at early Christian remains along the Silk Route. In this chapter, I focus on Kazakhstan examining its history in the first millenium AD and discussing the expansion of Christianity first, and Islam afterwards, in this area - as evidenced from archaeological remains.
