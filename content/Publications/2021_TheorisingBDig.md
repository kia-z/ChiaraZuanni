This paper explores the characteristics of born digital objects and how their
materiality is framed and transformed in the musealization process. It draws on
vibrant materialism and web archiving, framing born digital objects as assemblages
and proposing a distinction between these and reborn digital objects, i.e. their
collected counterparts. The paper relates this new framing of digital objects to
established museological frameworks, such as analyses of the musealization
process through the lenses of semiotics and research on authenticity in relation
to digital reproductions, in order to unpick the ontological and epistemological
transformation this contemporary form of heritage undergoes in entering the
museum
