Based	on	empirical	research	conducted	as	part	of	the	Culture	Metrics	project	
(http://www.culturemetricsresearch.com/)	and	drawing	on	a	review	of	relevant	
literature	and	related	practices	and	initiatives	across	the	sector,	this	paper	provides	
an	examination	of	processes,	mechanisms,	and	challenges	for	establishing	and	using	
data	sets	in	capturing	and	evaluating	cultural	performance	and	experiences.	It	raises	
questions	about	how	cultural	organisations	collect	and	use	data	to	analyse	their	
practices,	discusses	frameworks	for	such	data	collection	and	analysis,	and	examines	
issues	arising	from	data	sharing	and	benchmarking.	Based	on	this	analysis	and	the	
experience	of	the	Culture	Metrics	project,	the	paper	reflects	on	the	emergence	of	a	
data	culture	in	organisations	for	performance	measurement,	self-evaluation,	and	
data-driven	decision	making.
