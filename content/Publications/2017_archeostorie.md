This paper analyses the activities of Italian cultural institutions and Twitter
users during Museum Week 2016, a global event promoting museums on this
platform. The paper draws on recent research in the field of museum and
heritage studies to assess the characteristics of social media engagement in
the Italian heritage sector and the challenges still to be overcome. By drawing
on the case study of Museum Week, an initiative which has been celebrated
by the media as a success of Italian museums, the paper will unpack digital
engagement practices and evaluation methodologies, questioning the reach
and breadth of social media engagement achieved during the week by Italian
institutions. The paper concludes by highlighting the current potential and
limitations of digital engagement practices in Italy.
