Public archaeology examines the points of contact between archaeologists and the wider world, and seeks to improve and promote these relationships. As a practice, it is as old as archaeology, but as a field of study it is relatively modern. It focuses on fields as diverse as education, nationalist politics, heritage in wartime, and the ethics of repatriating cultural property. The growth of digital media in public archaeology provides a range of opportunities, including new approaches to old problems, and the discipline continues to grow in scope and ambition.
