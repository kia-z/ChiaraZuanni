shortDesc: "The project aimed to develop a comparative critique of approaches to universal histories in museums and of the role of museums in building knowledge about the future. I was based at the Victoria and Albert Museum and worked on its archives, as well as the archives of partner institutions in the UK (e.g. Science Museum) and France (musée du quai Branly, Musèe de l'Homme)."

The project aimed to develop a comparative critique of approaches to universal histories in museums and of the role of museums in building knowledge about the future. I was the postdoctoral researcher on the project and I was therefore responsible of archival research (in London and Paris), co-organisation of the four workshops, development of the project website and its digital exhibition.
