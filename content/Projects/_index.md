During my PhD, I was research assistant on a series of (mainly) digital heritage research projects at the University of Manchester. Afterwards, I held two main postdoctoral positions, contributing to research projects in Liverpool and London. Since my move to Graz in 2018, I have started to take up more responsibilities and to lead (or co-lead) research projects.
