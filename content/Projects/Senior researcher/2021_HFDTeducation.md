shortDesc: 'This small project aims to research the use of museum digital material in school programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on the case-study of the GrazMuseum and local schools, we will observe how museum digital material has been used and adapted in education during this period, using videoethnographies and developing a videogame and testing it with secondary school students.'
