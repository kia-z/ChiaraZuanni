shortDesc: 'The project is using LiDAR scans and photogrammetry to create a virtual museum of the cast collection (Gipsmuseum) of the department of archaeology. In parallel, archaeological information on the originals is being collected, as well as data on the history of the casts. This information will be modelled (with LIDO) and presented alongside the 3D reconstructions in a GAMS project. It is a subproject of DITAH, a large infrastructure project led by the University of Graz.'
