The project, part of a larger research programme by the PIs, focused on the development of a social media-based treasure hunt around the University of Manchester campus and Manchester cultural institutions, to engage students.
My tasks included the preparation of the event (maps; hints; dissemination of QR codes and material for the "hunt"), supporting it (monitoring relevant social media channels and hashtags), and contributing to data collection for its evaluation and reporting.
