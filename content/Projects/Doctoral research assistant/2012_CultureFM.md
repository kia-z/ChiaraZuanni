CultureFM explored different ways of using and interacting over Twitter, researching how these different ways of communicatoin could enhance digital engagement with arts organisations. 
As a research assistant, I did a review of existing Twitter analysis tools and methods; I supported the events (dissemination and technical support during the streams); and I contributed to collect and analyse data about the engagement generated.
