I have supported the Kipling Society in developing a social media strategy; and I have developed social media analytics and evaluation reports for the Manchester Histories Festival and the School of Arts, Languages, and Cultures (University of Manchester). Besides, I have managed social media for a range of project and event accounts, as well as for some student engagement campaigns at the Institute for Cultural Practices (University of Manchester).
